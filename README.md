# Is Cyberpunk Delayed Yet Again?! A Discord Bot.

This is a Discord bot that uses **Selenium** as a web scrapper, to pull info from the website about CP2077 delays.

Just type ***".cp"*** in the chat and it's going to scrap for new info. There's a **1 minute cooldown** for that, in order to not put any unecessary stress on the Heroku server that it is hosted on, which means that it will send you, at that time, data that was temporarly saved from the last request.

**Notice 1: I am not associated with the original owner of the website in any way. I just wanted to make this, because I was bored.**
**Notice 2: This is not "production ready". If the bot breaks, that probably means that either the website layout has changed or something else happened.**
